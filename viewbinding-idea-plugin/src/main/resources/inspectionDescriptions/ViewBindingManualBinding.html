Reports manual definitions of a <code>binding</code> property in classes annotated with <code>@ViewBinding</code>.
<p>
    The ViewBinding compiler plugin automatically generates this property. A manual definition
    will conflict with the generated one, causing a compilation error.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Remove</b> the manual property and rely on the compiler plugin to generate it.
